# Asteroids_bw_Gravity
Classic game of Asteroids plus physics. :)

I will probably never complete this, but I have a ship that shoots and is affected by gravity.  I wanted to play around with math in c++ and calculating movement with gravity in a game before I moved onto another project and I accomplished that with this.
